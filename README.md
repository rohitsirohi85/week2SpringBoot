Spring Boot Learning - Week 2
Overview
This week, I focused on deepening my understanding of Spring Boot by exploring key concepts and implementing various functionalities. Below are the main topics I covered during Week 2.

Topics Covered
1. Service Layer
Understanding the Service Layer: Learned how to create and use service classes in Spring Boot to encapsulate business logic.
Dependency Injection: Implemented service classes using dependency injection to promote loose coupling and better testability.
2. PUT, PATCH, DELETE Mappings
PUT Mapping: Implemented endpoints to update entire resources.
PATCH Mapping: Worked on partial updates to resources, focusing on updating specific fields.
DELETE Mapping: Created endpoints to delete resources from the database.
3. Exception Handling
Global Exception Handling: Set up a global exception handler using @ControllerAdvice to manage exceptions across the application.
Custom Exceptions: Developed custom exception classes to handle specific error scenarios and provide meaningful error messages to the client.
4. Validation
Input Validation: Applied validation annotations like @NotNull, @Size, @Email, etc., to ensure that the data coming into the application meets the required criteria.
Custom Validation: Created custom validation annotations and validators for more complex validation logic.
Handling Validation Errors: Configured how validation errors are reported to the client, ensuring a consistent error response formatDifferent types of mappings and error exceptions handling
